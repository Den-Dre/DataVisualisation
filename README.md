# Data Visualisation: Project Problem Statement
As the data analytics team at Spotify, our goal is to understand evolving musical trends and
how they influence the popularity of tracks on our platform.
One analysis we want to conduct focuses on the relationship between a song’s emotional
valence (positivity/negativity) and its popularity by genre, while also examining how this
relationship changes seasonally and during times of global distress. Our hypothesis is that
major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian war cause shifts in listener
preferences towards tracks with certain emotional tones, serving as a barometer for public
mood.

For example, if our data analysis shows users gravitate towards more positively-valenced
music during difficult times, we could adjust our recommendations to feature more uplifting
tracks as a compassionate response. Conversely, a preference shift towards more
negatively-valenced music could lead us to recommend more sombre and reflective songs
instead.
This nuanced approach can make the listening experience more compassionate and
personalised, potentially increasing user satisfaction and engagement.

## Questions
How do preferences of song attributes change over time? Do emotions have an impact on popularity of songs?

1. How do preferences of song attributes differ between regions?
2. Is there a correlation between attributes of popular songs and globally distressing
events (eg: pandemic)?
3. Have preferences in genres and artists changed over time since 2017?
4. Are there any seasonal changes in preferences for popular songs (eg: slower songs
in the winter, high danceability in the summer)?
5. Do concerts in the region have a correlation with the artists’ or genres’ popularity? Do
artists have an impact on preferences?
6. Prediction model of song attributes that relate to higher popularity
